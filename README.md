# Pathfinder 1e - Wound Thresholds with Wounds & Vigor

A crude implementation of a wounds & vigor and wound threshold
compatibility patch for Pathfinder 1e for FoundryVTT.

The following conditions are automatically applied:
- **Fatigued:** Character reaches 0 vigor.
- **Grazed:** Character loses at least 1 wound point.
- **Wounded:** Character loses at least 1/4 of their wounds.
- **Critical:** Character loses at least 1/2 of their wounds.
